Maximillian gave a very good overview of how React works.  When using create-react-app, there are some essential
files at the top level which enable the application to work:

1.  package.json
2.  index.css
3.  index.js
4.  index.html
5.  App.js

The center of activity is index.js:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

import './index.css';
import App from './App';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Maximillian stated React is actually split across to libraries, react and react-dom, both of which are imported
in package.json:

"react": "^18.0.0",
"react-dom": "^18.0.0",
-------------------------------------------------------------------
So create-react-app imports ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client' making that object available to our application.
It also imports "index.css" and the App itself.  Note in normal Javascript we could not import CSS into a
Javascript file the transformation code in create-react-app (when we run npm start) does the necessary
transformations to make this work.

We import the App, since this is a Javascript file we need to remove the suffix, all other files (like the css)
need to retain their suffixes.

The index.html file is a simple html file which has an empty <div> element in the <body> with id "root".

<div id="root"></div>, the ReactDOM grabs this element in the code above and calls the "createRoot" method
on it.  Then in the last line of code the root constant calls the render method on App.

Note the root div is nothing more than a place holder into which we place our high level React component called
App.  If we look at App, we see it is not normal Javascript.  It is a React component but it has normal Javascript
function syntax.  The difference is that it returns somethig that looks like HTML, in fact this HTML like syntax
is called JSX, which we will learn about shortly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is our App component:
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Let's get started!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
--------------------------------------------
Again as Maximillian noted transformations happen when the application is run which turn the above code into
browser friendly code.  If we run the application we can use the Chrome Developer Tools and go to sources and
in the sources tab we will see a static/js folder in that folder we see a number of files.  One of those files
will contain an App function which looks substantially different that our App component.  This is because that
different App function is taking our easy to read App component and transforming it into something the browser
can understand.

this is important because React enables the developer to write code which is easy to understand and then the
library itself assumes the resposibility of transforming the code into something the browser can understand.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How React works:
React takes a "Declarative Approach" to application development, specifically:

1.  React allows one to create re-usable and reactive components consisting of HTML, Javascript, and CSS
2.  One defines the target state and then React figures out the actual Javascript DOM instructions

Note compared to React using straight Javascript, HTML, CSS is called an "Imperative" approach, because you
would have to tell Javascript what to do:

1.  Create a paragraph element.
2.  Insert text into the newly created paragraph element.
3.  Insert the paragraph element somewhere in the DOM.

React is declarative, what one does is define the end state(s) and then the React library figures out what
DOM instructions to use to bring the desired state to the screen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A component in React is nothing more than a function.  Before the advent of hooks and functional components,
components in React where classes.  Note about the naming conventions for components, for custom components
always use PascalCase which is like camelCase but the first work is capitalized.  React looks for components
which are PascalCase and identifies them as custom components.  When components in JSX begin with lower case,
React identifies them as standard HTML elements (div, p, h2, etc)
